### Template 3: Media Pitch (Publications)

**Subject:** Story Pitch: The Hidden Thyroid Crisis Affecting Black Women

**Body:**
```
Hi [Editor Name],

I'm pitching a story about the thyroid health crisis disproportionately affecting Black women—and why mainstream medicine keeps missing it.

**The Pitch:**
"Why Black Women Are 3X More Likely to Have Thyroid Disease—And What Doctors Aren't Telling Us"

**The Hook:**
Black women have the highest rates of thyroid disease but are chronically underdiagnosed. When we do get diagnosed, we're often dismissed, undertreated, and told our symptoms are "just stress."

**Why Now:**
- Thyroid disease is at epidemic levels (20+ million Americans)
- Black women health is finally getting mainstream attention
- More women are taking health advocacy into their own hands

**What Makes This Story Unique:**
I've lived it. After 7 years of navigating thyroid disease as a Black woman, I built a platform (Ask DoGood) to help others avoid my mistakes. I have:
- Personal story arc (misdiagnosis → healing → advocacy)
- Clinical protocols that work
- Community of 1,500+ women experiencing this
- Expertise in the intersection of systemic racism + healthcare

**Proposed Article:**
- 1,200-1,500 words
- Mix of personal narrative + actionable advice
- Data on health disparities
- Expert quotes (can provide or you can source)
- Solutions-oriented (not just problem-focused)

I can send a draft on spec or we can discuss angle adjustments.

Would this fit your editorial calendar?

Thank you for considering,
RoSeé Murphy
Founder, Ask DoGood
