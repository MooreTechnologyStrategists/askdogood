## MODULE 1: UNDERSTANDING YOUR THYROID
### Video Length: 8-10 minutes

### Key Concepts:

#### 1. THYROID BASICS

Your thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in your neck that produces hormones controlling:
- **Metabolism** (how fast you burn calories)
- **Energy levels** (how tired you feel)
- **Temperature regulation** (why you're always cold or hot)
- **Mood** (depression, anxiety, mood swings)
- **Weight** (difficulty losing weight)
- **Heart rate** (palpitations, racing heart)
- **Digestion** (constipation, diarrhea)
- **Hair, skin, nails** (thinning, dryness, brittleness)

#### 2. THE HORMONES

**T4 (Thyroxine)**
- The INACTIVE form
- Made by your thyroid
- Must be converted to T3 to work
- Most thyroid meds replace T4

**T3 (Triiodothyronine)**
- The ACTIVE form
- What your cells actually use
- About 80% comes from T4 conversion
- About 20% made directly by thyroid

**The Conversion Problem:**
Most people with thyroid issues have a CONVERSION problem, not a production problem.
- Your thyroid MAKES enough T4
- Your body CAN'T convert it to T3
- So you feel terrible despite "normal" labs

**What breaks conversion?**
- Nutrient deficiencies (selenium, zinc, iron, B vitamins)
- Chronic stress
- Inflammation
- Gut problems
- Liver dysfunction
- Sleep deprivation

#### 3. THYROID CONDITIONS

**HYPOTHYROIDISM** (Underactive Thyroid)
- Your thyroid doesn't produce enough hormones
- Most common thyroid condition
- More common in women
- Can develop after pregnancy, at menopause

Symptoms:
- Extreme fatigue, even with sleep
- Weight gain despite diet
- Feeling cold all the time
- Constipation
- Depression, brain fog, anxiety
- Hair loss, dry skin
- Muscle aches
- Infertility or irregular periods

Common Causes:
- Hashimoto's disease (autoimmune attack)
- Iodine deficiency
- Medication (beta-blockers, lithium)
- Pregnancy
- Radiation therapy

**HASHIMOTO'S DISEASE** (Autoimmune Hypothyroidism)
- Your immune system attacks your thyroid
- Most common cause of hypothyroidism
- More common in women
- Often runs in families
- Can fluctuate—sometimes symptoms better, sometimes worse

Symptoms:
- All hypothyroidism symptoms PLUS
- Frequent infections
- Autoimmune-related conditions
- Food sensitivities
- Thyroid antibodies present on tests

Root Causes Often Include:
- Gluten sensitivity (molecular mimicry)
- Leaky gut
- Chronic stress
- Viral infections
- Nutrient deficiencies

**HYPERTHYROIDISM** (Overactive Thyroid)
- Your thyroid produces too much hormone
- Less common than hypothyroidism
- More common in women, especially younger women

Symptoms:
- Racing heart, palpitations
- Anxiety, nervousness
- Trembling hands
- Heat intolerance, excessive sweating
- Weight loss despite eating
- Frequent bowel movements
- Sleep problems

Common Causes:
- Graves' disease (autoimmune)
- Thyroiditis (inflamed thyroid)
- Thyroid nodules
- Medication side effects

**THYROID RESISTANCE**
- Your body makes hormones
- Labs look "normal"
- YOUR cells can't use them
- You feel terrible with "normal" labs

Root Causes:
- Inflammation
- Cellular receptor issues
- Vitamin D deficiency
- Excess reverse T3
- Chronic stress

#### 4. WHY DOCTORS MISS IT

**The Problem:** Most doctors test ONLY TSH

**TSH = Thyroid Stimulating Hormone**
- Released by your pituitary gland
- Tells your thyroid to make more hormones
- If TSH is normal, doctor assumes thyroid is fine
- **BUT this is incomplete!**

**What TSH doesn't tell you:**
- If you're actually converting T4 to T3
- If you have autoimmune thyroid disease
- If your cells are using the hormones
- If you have reverse T3 (inactive form) buildup

**The Complete Lab Panel You Need:**

```
BASIC PANEL (MINIMUM):
☐ TSH
☐ Free T4
☐ Free T3
☐ TPO antibodies
☐ Thyroglobulin antibodies

COMPLETE PANEL (OPTIMAL):
☐ TSH
☐ Free T4
☐ Free T3
☐ Reverse T3
☐ TPO antibodies
☐ Thyroglobulin antibodies
☐ Vitamin D (25-OH)
☐ Iron (ferritin, serum iron, TIBC)
☐ Vitamin B12
☐ Folate
☐ Magnesium
☐ Zinc
☐ Selenium
☐ Cortisol (AM and/or 24-hour)
```

**Optimal Ranges (not "normal" ranges):**

| Test | Lab Range | Optimal Range | Why |
|------|-----------|---------------|-----|
| TSH | 0.4-4.0 | 0.5-2.0 | Higher ranges miss many cases |
| Free T4 | 8-17 | 12-14 | Needs to be midrange-high |
| Free T3 | 2.3-4.2 | 3.5-4.2 | Higher = more energy |
| Reverse T3 | 9.2-24 | <15 (ratio) | Lower is better |
| Vitamin D | 30-100 | 60-80 | Thyroid needs high levels |
| Ferritin | 12-200 | 40-100 | Low = poor conversion |
| B12 | 200-900 | 500+ | Critical for thyroid |

#### 5. ROOT CAUSES OF THYROID DISEASE

**You can't just take medication and expect to heal.**

Your thyroid didn't fail randomly. Something triggered it. Find and fix that trigger, or you'll keep struggling.

**Common Triggers:**

**GLUTEN** (especially Hashimoto's)
- Gluten protein resembles thyroid tissue
- Immune system attacks both (molecular mimicry)
- Only affects people with genetic predisposition
- Test: Celiac panel + trial elimination
- Action: 100% gluten-free for 90 days, then retest

**STRESS & CORTISOL**
- Chronic stress depletes: selenium, zinc, B vitamins
- High cortisol increases inflammation
- Suppresses immune function (paradoxically worsens autoimmune)
- Also impairs T4→T3 conversion
- Action: Stress management (sleep, meditation, exercise)

**GUT HEALTH**
- 70% of immune system in gut
- Leaky gut increases inflammation
- Dysbiosis (bad bacteria) worsens autoimmune
- Poor digestion = nutrient malabsorption
- Action: Eliminate trigger foods, add probiotics

**INFECTIONS**
- Viral infections (EBV, COVID, herpes)
- Bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)
- Parasites
- Can trigger autoimmune response
- Action: Targeted antimicrobial protocols

**NUTRIENT DEFICIENCIES**
- Selenium → T4→T3 conversion broken
- Zinc → Immune function broken
- Iron → Can't bind oxygen in thyroid
- B vitamins → Methylation broken
- Magnesium → Stress response broken
- Action: Test and supplement based on results

**ENVIRONMENTAL TOXINS**
- Mercury (fish, old fillings)
- Lead (water, old paint)
- Mold (water-damaged homes)
- Pesticides
- Interfere with thyroid function
- Action: Reduce exposure, support detox

**INFLAMMATION**
- Any chronic inflammation triggers autoimmune response
- Processed foods, seed oils, sugar increase inflammation
- Intestinal inflammation (leaky gut, IBS, IBD)
- Action: Anti-inflammatory diet and lifestyle

## MODULE 2: THYROID-SUPPORTIVE NUTRITION
### Video Length: 10-12 minutes

### Key Principles:

Food is information. Every bite you eat either:
- **Reduces inflammation and supports healing**, OR
- **Increases inflammation and worsens symptoms**

This isn't about calories or restriction. It's about eating the foods that your thyroid needs to function.

### FOODS TO PRIORITIZE

#### SELENIUM-RICH FOODS (need 200mcg daily)

**Why?** Selenium is ESSENTIAL for converting T4 to T3. Without it, you're stuck with inactive hormones.

**Top Sources:**
- Brazil nuts (2-3 per day, not more—selenium is toxic in excess)
- Wild-caught fish (salmon, sardines, mackerel, halibut)
- Pasture-raised eggs (especially yolk)
- Grass-fed beef, liver
- Chicken
- Turkey

**Daily Goal:** 2-3 Brazil nuts OR 3oz wild fish OR 2 eggs

#### ZINC-RICH FOODS (need 15-30mg daily)

**Why?** Zinc supports thyroid hormone production and immune function.

**Top Sources:**
- Oysters, clams, shellfish (highest)
- Grass-fed beef
- Pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds
- Chickpeas, lentils
- Cashews
- Mushrooms

**Daily Goal:** 3oz beef OR 1/4 cup pumpkin seeds OR 6 oysters

#### IODINE (but CAREFULLY!)

**Why?** Your thyroid NEEDS iodine to make hormones.

**BUT:** Too much iodine can WORSEN Hashimoto's. Less is more.

**Quality Sources:**
- Wild-caught fish (best source)
- Seaweed/kelp (use sparingly—very concentrated)
- Sea salt (small amounts)
- Eggs (if hens eat iodized feed)

**Daily Goal:** One serving fish 3x week, or minimal seaweed

**Avoid:** Iodine supplements or "thyroid support" products with kelp

#### IRON-RICH FOODS (need 18-27mg daily for women)

**Why?** Iron is required for thyroid hormone production and oxygen transport.

**Best Sources (highest absorption):**
- Grass-fed red meat (especially liver—super nutrient dense)
- Lamb
- Wild-caught fish
- Spinach, kale, Swiss chard
- Lentils, chickpeas
- Blackstrap molasses

**Absorption Tip:** Pair with Vitamin C (citrus, berries) for better absorption. Avoid with calcium or coffee (blocks absorption).

**Daily Goal:** 3-4oz red meat OR large serving leafy greens

#### VITAMIN D-RICH FOODS (need 5,000IU daily)

**Why?** 70% of thyroid patients are deficient in Vitamin D. It's critical for immune regulation.

**Sources:**
- Wild-caught fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, sardines)
- Pasture-raised egg yolks
- Mushrooms (exposed to sunlight)
- Cod liver oil
- **Sunlight** (best source—15-20 min daily without sunscreen)

**Daily Goal:** Sunlight + one fatty fish serving, OR supplement

#### MAGNESIUM-RICH FOODS (need 400-600mg daily)

**Why?** Magnesium is needed for T4→T3 conversion AND stress response.

**Top Sources:**
- Pumpkin seeds
- Almonds, cashews
- Spinach, kale
- Dark chocolate (70%+ cacao)
- Avocado
- Beans, lentils

**Daily Goal:** Handful of seeds/nuts, large salad, or 1oz dark chocolate

#### AMINO ACIDS & PROTEIN

**Why?** Thyroid hormones are made of amino acids. Need 25-30g protein at each meal.

**Best Sources:**
- Grass-fed beef, lamb, bison
- Wild-caught fish and shellfish
- Pasture-raised eggs
- Organic chicken
- Bone broth (collagen + minerals)

---

### FOODS TO AVOID OR MINIMIZE

#### GLUTEN (especially if Hashimoto's)

**Why?** The protein structure of gluten resembles thyroid tissue. Your immune system attack both.

**Contains Gluten:**
- Wheat, barley, rye
- Most bread, pasta, cereals
- Beer, many sauces
- Processed foods (check labels—hidden everywhere)

**Action:** 
- Go 100% gluten-free for 90 days
- Notice if symptoms improve
- Retest antibodies after 3 months
- Many people reverse Hashimoto's with this alone

#### UNFERMENTED SOY

**Why?** Soy contains goitrogens that inhibit thyroid hormone production. Blocks iodine.

**Avoid:**
- Soy milk, soy yogurt
- Tofu, tempeh, edamame (unfermented)
- Soy protein powder
- Check labels—soy is in SO many foods

**Exception:** Fermented soy (miso, tamari, tempeh) is OK in small amounts

#### PROCESSED SEED OILS

**Why?** High in omega-6, which increases inflammation and worsens autoimmune.

**Avoid:**
- Canola oil
- Soybean oil
- Corn oil
- Vegetable oil
- Cottonseed oil
- Grapeseed oil (in many processed foods)

**Use Instead:**
- Olive oil (cold-pressed, extra virgin)
- Avocado oil
- Coconut oil
- Ghee
- Butter (yes, real butter!)
- Sesame oil

#### RAW CRUCIFEROUS VEGETABLES (in large amounts)

**Why?** When raw and in large quantities, they contain goitrogens that block iodine. But cooked is fine.

**Watch Out For:**
- Raw kale in smoothies
- Large raw broccoli salads
- Raw cabbage
- Raw Brussels sprouts

**Solution:** Cook them! Cooking deactivates goitrogens.
- Roast, steam, sauté, or blend into cooked dishes
- Eating cooked cruciferous is GOOD and healthy

#### SUGAR & REFINED CARBS

**Why?** Blood sugar spikes → insulin spikes → inflammation → cortisol spikes → more thyroid problems.

**Avoid:**
- Cookies, candy, pastries
- Sugary cereals
- Juice, soda, energy drinks
- Refined grains (white bread, regular pasta)
- Processed foods with added sugar

**Instead:**
- Complex carbs (sweet potato, oats, quinoa, brown rice)
- Paired with protein & fat (slower digestion)

#### EXCESS ALCOHOL

**Why?** Destroys gut lining, disrupts hormones, depletes nutrients.

**Action:** Eliminate for 90 days while healing. After that, occasional wine OK.

### MEAL STRUCTURE FOR THYROID HEALTH

#### BREAKFAST (within 1 hour of waking)

**Why timing matters?**
- Stabilizes cortisol rhythm
- Supports stable blood sugar all day
- Prevents energy crashes

**Include:**
- Protein: 25-30g (eggs, meat, Greek yogurt)
- Healthy fats (avocado, nuts, olive oil)
- Complex carbs (sweet potato, oats, berries)

**Sample Breakfasts:**
1. 3 eggs + sautéed spinach + sweet potato hash + olive oil
2. Turkey sausage + avocado + berries + almond butter
3. Grass-fed beef patties + asparagus + ghee
4. Bone broth + eggs + toast + sauerkraut
5. Collagen smoothie (collagen + berries + spinach + almond butter + coconut oil)

#### LUNCH (protein + plants)

**Include:**
- Protein: 4-5oz (fish, beef, chicken)
- Large salad OR cooked vegetables
- Complex carbs (rice, quinoa, sweet potato)
- Healthy fat (olive oil, avocado, nuts)

**Sample Lunches:**
1. Grilled salmon + large arugula salad + olive oil + quinoa
2. Grass-fed beef + roasted vegetables + brown rice
3. Rotisserie chicken + steamed broccoli + white potato
4. Wild-caught halibut + cooked kale + sweet potato fries
5. Turkey meatballs + zucchini noodles + marinara sauce

#### DINNER (lighter, eaten earlier)

**Timing:** Eat 3 hours before bed (better sleep)

**Include:**
- Protein: 3-4oz
- Cooked vegetables (broccoli, Brussels sprouts, spinach)
- Avoid heavy carbs at night
- Use less oil/fat

**Sample Dinners:**
1. Baked cod + asparagus + mashed cauliflower
2. Lamb chops + roasted Brussels sprouts + olive oil
3. Chicken breast + sautéed spinach + carrot sticks
4. Turkey meatballs + marinara + zucchini
5. Shrimp + green beans + garlic

#### SNACKS (if needed)

**Between meals should be 4-5 hours (supports digestion)**

But if you need a snack:
- Apple + almond butter
- Brazil nuts (2-3 only)
- Hard-boiled eggs
- String cheese
- Cucumber + hummus
- Handful of berries + almonds

#### HYDRATION & TIMING

**Water:**
- Drink half your body weight in ounces daily
- Add pinch of sea salt + lemon (electrolytes & minerals)
- Exception: Drink less before bedtime

**Coffee Timing:**
- WAIT 90 minutes after waking before coffee
- Why? Your cortisol naturally peaks at 8am. Coffee on empty stomach spikes it further.
- Drink WITH food to minimize stress response
- No coffee after 2pm (disrupts sleep)

**Alcohol:**
- Eliminate for 90 days during healing
- After healing, limit to 1x week, with food
- Damages gut, disrupts hormones, depletes nutrients

---

### YOUR MEAL PLAN TEMPLATE

**For the next 2 weeks, plan your meals using this:**

**Monday:**
- Breakfast: ___________________________
- Lunch: ___________________________
- Dinner: ___________________________
- Snack: ___________________________

**Tuesday:**
- Breakfast: ___________________________
- Lunch: ___________________________
- Dinner: ___________________________
- Snack: ___________________________

(Continue for all 7 days × 2 weeks)

## MODULE 3: ESSENTIAL SUPPLEMENTS
### Video Length: 8-10 minutes

### The Supplement Strategy

**Key Point:** Supplements support healing, but they don't REPLACE diet and lifestyle.

**Priority Order:**
1. Fix diet first
2. Reduce stress
3. Sleep better
4. Then add strategic supplements

### FOUNDATIONAL SUPPLEMENTS (Everyone needs these)

These 5 are the foundation. Start here.

#### 1. SELENIUM (200mcg daily)

**Why?** Critical for converting T4 to T3. Without it, you're stuck with inactive hormones.

**Research Shows:** Selenium supplementation reduces TPO antibodies in Hashimoto's by 20-40%.

**How to Take:**
- 200mcg daily (usually 1 capsule)
- Take with food
- Morning or afternoon

**Best Brands:**
- Thorne
- Seeking Health
- Life Extension
- Pure Encapsulations

**Cost:** $15-25/month

#### 2. ZINC (25-30mg daily)

**Why?** Needed for thyroid hormone production, immune regulation, and nutrient absorption.

**How to Take:**
- 25-30mg daily (usually 1 capsule)
- Take with dinner (can cause nausea on empty stomach)
