## 💡 RECOMMENDATIONS

### Professional Medical Styling:
- Current approach successfully removes playful elements
- Site now feels more like WebMD/Mayo Clinic (professional, trustworthy)
- Consider keeping some personality in blog/story sections while keeping health content medical

### Gumroad vs. Contact Form:
- Gumroad provides instant digital delivery
- Tracks sales automatically
- Handles payment processing securely
- Can still offer 1:1 consultations via contact form for custom services

### Mobile Responsiveness:
- New hero image (384px) may be too large on small screens
- Test on mobile devices
- Consider using `w-56 md:w-96` (224px mobile, 384px desktop) if needed

## 🐛 POTENTIAL ISSUES TO WATCH

1. **Hero Image Aspect Ratio**: Circular mask may crop faces awkwardly
   - Solution: Use `object-position: center top` if face gets cut off

2. **Gumroad Links**: Need to be updated once actual products are created
   - Placeholder used: `https://askdogood.gumroad.com/l/[product-slug]`

3. **Recipe External Links**: Currently linking to `/recipe/*` pages that don't exist yet
   - Will return 404 until pages are created

4. **Unsplash Images**: Using placeholder images for recipes
   - Replace with actual food photography when available

---

## 📞 SUPPORT NEEDED FROM YOU

Please provide:
1. ✅ Your outdoor selfie photos (uploaded via attachments - RECEIVED)
2. ❌ Diverse product cover images or guidance on creating them
3. ❌ Confirmation of Gumroad product URLs once created
4. ❌ Recipe photography or approve use of stock images
5. ❌ Personal slideshow photos (you in kitchen/cooking)
