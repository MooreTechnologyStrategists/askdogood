# Missing Images - What You Need to Do

## 🎯 Current Situation

Your code is working perfectly! The images just don't exist yet in Azure storage.

**Missing Images:**
1. ❌ `images/stories/chyna-white-cover.webp` - Chyna White character art
2. ❌ Other story/character images

**What You See Instead:**
- 👑 emoji placeholder with "Character art coming soon"
- This is the fallback I built into the code!

## ✅ How to Fix (3 Options)

### Option 1: Generate with AI (Recommended - 15 minutes)

**Step 1: Generate the Image**

**Step 2: Use This Prompt**

Copy this from [CHYNA_WHITE_CHARACTER_ART.md](CHYNA_WHITE_CHARACTER_ART.md):

```

**Step 3: Download the Image**

## 🚀 Quick Win: Use Placeholder Until Real Art is Ready

Want to launch NOW? I can update the code to use a temporary image while you create the real character art:

**Temporary options:**
1. Use one of your existing personal photos
2. Use a abstract/artistic placeholder
3. Keep the emoji placeholder (actually looks cool!)

Let me know if you want me to:

- [ ] Update the fallback styling to look more intentional
- [ ] Create a "Coming Soon" banner for the stories section
