## 🎁 BONUS EMAIL: POST-LAUNCH

**Send: Day 6 (Tuesday Morning)**

**Subject: "I increased the price (but I have good news)"**

```
Hey [FIRST NAME],

As promised, the Thyroid Health Mastery Course is now $197.

The $97 launch price is officially over.

But I have good news...

I'm opening 10 MORE spots at the launch price for people who:
1. Reached out and had genuine financial hardship
2. Emailed me with specific questions
3. Were in my DMs asking for help

If that's you, reply to this email with "LAST CHANCE" 
and I'll send you a special $97 link.

It expires in 24 hours.

This is the LAST time it'll ever be this price.

Talk soon,
RoSeé

P.S. If you already bought at $97, you're in! Check your email 
for access instructions. And THANK YOU. 🦋
```

## 📧 SEQUENCE FOR NON-BUYERS

### 7 Days After Launch:

**Email: "What stopped you?"**

```
Hey [FIRST NAME],

I noticed you didn't grab the Thyroid Health Mastery Course 
during the launch week.

No judgment. Life gets busy. Money gets tight. Timing isn't always perfect.

But I'm curious...

What held you back?

Hit reply and let me know:
- Was it the price?
- Not the right time?
- Needed to see more proof?
- Had specific questions I didn't answer?
- Something else?

I read every reply, and I genuinely want to know.

Maybe I can help in another way. Maybe I can answer questions. 
Maybe we can figure out a solution together.

Talk soon,
RoSeé

P.S. The course is now $197, but if price was the issue, 
let's chat about options.
```

## 🚨 EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEMPLATES

### If Someone Says It's Too Expensive:
```
"I completely understand. I've been there—broke, sick, and 
scared about every dollar. 

Would a payment plan help? $37/month for 3 months?

Or if you need more time, I can put you on a waitlist for 
the next scholarship program I'm creating.

Either way, I want to help. What works better for you?"
```

### If Someone Has Technical Issues:
```
"Oh no! Let me help you right now.

Can you send me a screenshot of what you're seeing? 
Or tell me what step isn't working?

I'll walk you through it personally. My tech support = me. 😊"
```

### If Someone Wants Refund:
```
"Absolutely, no problem at all.

I'll process your refund today. You should see it in 
3-5 business days.

Before you go, can I ask what didn't work for you? 
I genuinely want to improve.

Either way, wishing you all the best in your healing journey. 🦋"
