## VIDEO 1: Welcome & Course Overview (3-5 minutes)

### Script:

**[OPENING - 0:00-0:15]**
Welcome to Thyroid Health Mastery. I'm RoSeé Murphy, and this course is going to transform how you understand and manage your thyroid health.

**[PROBLEM - 0:15-0:45]**
If you're struggling with fatigue, weight gain, brain fog, or unexplained symptoms—and your doctor keeps saying "your labs are normal"—this course is for you.

You're not crazy. Your symptoms are real. And I'm going to show you exactly what to do about it.

**[SOLUTION - 0:45-1:30]**
In this course, you'll discover:
- How your thyroid actually works and why it's failing you
- The hidden root causes your doctor isn't testing for
- Exactly what to eat to support thyroid function
- Which supplements actually work (and which are a waste of money)
- How to read your own lab results and advocate for yourself

**[WHAT YOU'LL GET - 1:30-2:15]**
This isn't just information. It's a complete roadmap:
- 6 comprehensive modules
- Meal plans and recipes
- Supplement protocols
- Lab interpretation guides
- And lifetime access to all updates

**[YOUR JOURNEY - 2:15-2:45]**
I've worked with hundreds of women who felt dismissed by the medical system. Women who were told to "just lose weight" or "reduce stress."

But when they understood their thyroid and made strategic changes, everything shifted.

**[CALL TO ACTION - 2:45-3:00]**
Your healing journey starts now. Let's dive into Module 1.

## VIDEO 2: Module 1 - Understanding Your Thyroid (8-10 minutes)

### Script:

**[INTRO - 0:00-0:30]**
Let's talk about your thyroid. This tiny butterfly-shaped gland in your neck controls your metabolism, energy, mood, weight, and so much more.

When it's out of balance, everything feels harder.

**[SECTION 1: THYROID BASICS - 0:30-2:00]**
Your thyroid produces two main hormones: T4 and T3.

T4 is the inactive hormone. It's like a package waiting to be opened.

T3 is the active hormone. This is what your cells actually use for energy.

Here's the problem: Your body needs to convert T4 into T3. And for most women with thyroid issues, this conversion is broken.

**Why?**
- Nutrient deficiencies (selenium, zinc, iron)
- Chronic stress raising cortisol
- Gut inflammation and leaky gut
- Toxin exposure disrupting hormones

**[SECTION 2: WHAT GOES WRONG - 2:00-4:00]**
There are three main thyroid conditions:

**Hypothyroidism** - Your thyroid isn't producing enough hormones.
Symptoms: Fatigue, weight gain, cold hands and feet, constipation, depression.

**Hashimoto's Disease** - Your immune system attacks your thyroid.
This is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. Your body is literally destroying your thyroid gland.

**Thyroid Resistance** - You're producing hormones, but your cells can't use them.
Labs look "normal" but you feel terrible.

**[SECTION 3: WHY DOCTORS MISS IT - 4:00-6:00]**
Here's what most doctors do: They test TSH only.

TSH is your brain's signal to your thyroid. But it doesn't tell you:
- If you're converting T4 to T3
- If you have Hashimoto's antibodies
- If your cells are actually using the hormones

**You need these labs:**
- TSH (should be 0.5-2.0, not just "in range")
- Free T4
- Free T3
- Reverse T3
- TPO and TG antibodies (for Hashimoto's)
- Vitamin D, B12, ferritin, selenium

**[SECTION 4: ROOT CAUSES - 6:00-8:00]**
Your thyroid didn't just break. Something triggered it.

**Common triggers:**
- Gluten (for Hashimoto's specifically)
- Chronic stress depleting nutrients
- Birth control pills disrupting hormones
- Gut infections (SIBO, Candida, parasites)
- Heavy metals (mercury, lead)
- Mold exposure

**This is why medication alone doesn't fix it.**

You have to address the root cause, or you'll keep struggling.

**[CONCLUSION - 8:00-9:00]**
In the next module, we're going to cover exactly what to eat to support your thyroid, reduce inflammation, and start feeling like yourself again.

Your thyroid can heal. Let's do this together.

## VIDEO 3: Module 2 - Thyroid-Supportive Nutrition (10-12 minutes)

### Script:

**[INTRO - 0:00-0:30]**
Let's talk about food. Because what you eat directly impacts your thyroid function.

This isn't about restriction. It's about strategic nutrition that supports healing.

**[SECTION 1: FOODS TO PRIORITIZE - 0:30-3:00]**

**Selenium-rich foods:**
- Brazil nuts (just 2-3 per day)
- Wild-caught fish (salmon, sardines)
- Pasture-raised eggs
- Organ meats

Selenium is required to convert T4 to T3. Without it, you're stuck with inactive hormones.

**Zinc-rich foods:**
- Oysters, shellfish
- Grass-fed beef
- Pumpkin seeds
- Chickpeas

**Iodine (but carefully!):**
- Seaweed, kelp
- Wild fish
- Sea salt

Too much iodine can worsen Hashimoto's. Be careful.

**Iron-rich foods:**
- Grass-fed red meat
- Spinach, lentils
- Blackstrap molasses

Low iron = poor T4 to T3 conversion.

**[SECTION 2: FOODS TO AVOID - 3:00-5:30]**

**Gluten** - Especially if you have Hashimoto's
The protein structure of gluten resembles thyroid tissue. Your immune system attacks both.

Go 100% gluten-free for 90 days. Watch what happens.

**Soy (unfermented)** - Blocks thyroid hormone production
- Soy milk, tofu, soy protein isolate
- Read labels—it's hidden everywhere

**Processed vegetable oils** - Omega-6 inflammatory fats
- Canola, soybean, corn oil
- Use olive oil, avocado oil, coconut oil instead

**Excess raw cruciferous vegetables** - In large amounts, they're goitrogenic
- Raw kale, broccoli, cabbage
- Cook them to deactivate goitrogens

**Sugar and refined carbs** - Spike insulin, worsen inflammation
- Causes blood sugar crashes and cortisol spikes

**[SECTION 3: MEAL STRUCTURE - 5:30-8:00]**

**Breakfast (within 1 hour of waking):**
- Protein: 25-30g
- Healthy fats
- Low glycemic carbs

Example: Scrambled eggs with avocado and sweet potato

**Why?** Balances blood sugar and supports cortisol rhythm.

**Lunch (protein + plants):**
- Grass-fed beef or wild salmon
- Large salad with olive oil
- Quinoa or brown rice

**Dinner (lighter, earlier):**
- Eat 3 hours before bed
- Protein + cooked vegetables
- Avoid heavy carbs at night

**[SECTION 4: HYDRATION & TIMING - 8:00-10:00]**

**Water intake:**
- Half your body weight in ounces daily
- Add sea salt and lemon for minerals

**Coffee:**
- Wait 90 minutes after waking (cortisol timing)
- Don't drink on an empty stomach
- No coffee after 2pm

**Alcohol:**
- Eliminate for 90 days during healing phase
- It destroys gut lining and disrupts hormones

**[SECTION 5: SAMPLE MEAL PLAN - 10:00-11:30]**

**Day 1:**
- Breakfast: Turkey sausage, sautéed spinach, sweet potato hash
- Lunch: Grilled salmon salad with avocado and olive oil
- Dinner: Grass-fed beef stir-fry with broccoli and cauliflower rice
- Snack: Brazil nuts, apple with almond butter

**Day 2:**
- Breakfast: Smoothie with collagen, berries, spinach, almond butter
- Lunch: Chicken and quinoa bowl with roasted vegetables
- Dinner: Baked cod with asparagus and mashed cauliflower
- Snack: Hard-boiled eggs, cucumber slices

**[CONCLUSION - 11:30-12:00]**
Food is medicine. When you eat to support your thyroid, you'll notice:
- More energy
- Better sleep
- Clearer thinking
- Weight loss without trying

In the next module, we'll cover supplements and which ones actually move the needle.

## VIDEO 4: Module 3 - Essential Supplements (8-10 minutes)

### Script:

**[INTRO - 0:00-0:30]**

- Use quality fish oil or algae-based

**[SECTION 2: THYROID-SPECIFIC SUPPLEMENTS - 3:00-5:30]**

**6. L-Tyrosine (500mg daily)**
- Amino acid that builds thyroid hormones
- Take in morning on empty stomach
- Don't take if you have Graves' disease

**7. Ashwagandha (300-500mg daily)**
- Adaptogen that supports thyroid function
- Reduces cortisol and stress
- Best for hypothyroidism, not Hashimoto's

**8. Vitamin B Complex**
- Supports energy and methylation
- Choose methylated forms (methylfolate, methylcobalamin)
- Take in morning

**[SECTION 3: GUT HEALING SUPPLEMENTS - 5:30-7:30]**

**9. Probiotics (50 billion CFU)**

**[SECTION 4: WHAT TO AVOID - 7:30-9:00]**

**Don't waste money on:**
- Generic "thyroid support" blends (unknown doses)
- Kelp/iodine supplements (can worsen Hashimoto's)
- Biotin above 300mcg (skews lab results)

**Timing matters:**
- Take thyroid medication on empty stomach
- Wait 1 hour before supplements
- Iron and calcium block thyroid absorption

**[CONCLUSION - 9:00-10:00]**
Start with the foundational 5. Add thyroid-specific and gut healing based on your symptoms.

Quality matters. Buy from trusted brands with third-party testing.

Next module: Lab testing and how to interpret your results.
