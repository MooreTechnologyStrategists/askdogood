## �🚀 EMAIL #1: THE LAUNCH ANNOUNCEMENT
**Send: Tomorrow Morning (10 AM)**

---

**Subject Line Options (A/B Test These):**
1. "It's finally here (and I'm terrified)" ⭐ RECOMMENDED
2. "7 years in the making... launching today 🦋"
3. "The thyroid course I wish existed when I was diagnosed"
4. "Why I'm crying happy tears today..."
5. "[FIRST NAME], I made something for you"

---

**Email Body:**

---

**Subject: It's finally here (and I'm terrified)**

Hey [FIRST NAME],

I'm sitting here at my computer, hands shaking a little, about to hit "send" on something I've poured my heart into for months.

**The Thyroid Health Mastery Course is live.**

And I'm terrified. Not because I doubt the content—I know it works. I've lived it. I've helped hundreds of people with these exact strategies.

I'm terrified because this is *personal*. This is 7+ years of:
- Misdiagnoses and dismissive doctors
- Learning to advocate when I could barely stand
- Finding what actually works (not what "should" work)
- Building a life I love despite chronic illness

All wrapped up in one comprehensive course.

### Here's what I need you to know:

**This isn't theory.** This is battle-tested wisdom from someone who's been in the trenches.

**This isn't just information.** This is transformation—understanding your body, advocating effectively, and finally feeling like *you* again.

**This isn't a quick fix.** This is a roadmap for the long game, because healing thyroid issues takes time, strategy, and someone who actually *gets it*.

### What's Inside:
✨ 6 comprehensive video modules (3+ hours)  
📊 Lab interpretation that actually makes sense  
💊 Medication optimization strategies (all types)  
🥗 Thyroid-supporting nutrition protocols  
💬 Private Facebook community (200+ warriors)  
📱 Lifetime access + all future updates  
✅ 30-day money-back guarantee (no questions asked)

**Regular Price:** $197  
**Launch Price:** $97 (50% OFF)  
**This price ends:** Monday at midnight

👉 **[GET THE COURSE NOW]** (INSERT LINK)

---

### This is for you if:

- You're tired of doctors who don't listen or understand
- Your labs say "normal" but you feel *terrible*
- You want to understand your body and what it needs
- You're ready to be your own best advocate
- You need a roadmap that actually works for real life

### This is NOT for you if:

- You're looking for a magic pill or overnight cure
- You're not willing to do the work
- You want someone else to fix you without your participation

---

**A note about the price:**

I'm capping this launch at 50 people for $97. After that, it goes to $197.

Why? Because I want to keep the community intimate and manageable. I want to be able to answer questions, provide support, and actually *know* the people I'm serving.

Once we hit 50, the price increases. Period.

**Current spots taken:** 0/50  
**Time remaining at this price:** 72 hours

👉 **[SECURE YOUR SPOT - $97]** (INSERT LINK)

---

### My Promise to You:

If you don't feel like this course gave you more clarity, understanding, and practical strategies than you've gotten from YEARS of doctor appointments...

I'll refund every penny. No hoops. No hassle.

You have 30 days to decide. That's how confident I am that this will change your life.

---

### Real Talk:

I know $97 might feel like a lot. Trust me, I get it. I've been broke, sick, and scared about every penny.

But think about this:
- One doctor visit with labs: $200-500
- One month of supplements: $50-150
- Years of feeling like crap: Priceless

This course gives you the knowledge to make every one of those dollars work *better* for your healing.

Plus, I offer payment plans: $37/month for 3 months. Because I remember what it's like to need help but not have it all upfront.

I'm rooting for you. I believe in you. And I can't wait to see you thrive.

Let's do this together. 🦋

**Healing out loud,**

**P.S.** Still on the fence? Here's what Maya from DC said:

*"This course changed everything. I finally understand my body and how to advocate for myself. Within 3 months, my energy returned and I feel like ME again."*

That could be you. 💙

## 📧 EMAIL #2: THE STORY EMAIL
**Send: Day 2 (Morning)**

---

**Subject Line Options:**
1. "The day I couldn't get out of bed..." ⭐ RECOMMENDED
2. "Why I almost gave up (and didn't)"
3. "Nobody believed me. Not even my doctors."
4. "This is what they don't tell you about thyroid disease"

---

**Email Body:**

---

**Subject: The day I couldn't get out of bed...**

Hey [FIRST NAME],

I want to tell you about the day that changed everything.

It was a Tuesday. I remember because I had an important meeting at work—one I'd been preparing for all week.

I woke up and literally could not lift my head off the pillow.

Not "I'm tired and don't want to."  
Not "I hit snooze too many times."

**I. Could. Not. Move.**

My body felt like it weighed 500 pounds. My brain was wrapped in cotton. Even breathing felt hard.

I called in sick. Again. For the third time that month.

And I cried. Because I knew people were starting to think I was faking it. Hell, *I* was starting to wonder if I was crazy.

---

### The Part Nobody Talks About:

The doctors told me I was fine. My labs were "normal."

Maybe it's stress.  
Maybe it's depression.  
Maybe you should exercise more.  
Maybe you should lose weight.

**Maybe. Maybe. Maybe.**

But never "Maybe your thyroid is destroying your life and we should actually help you."

---

### Here's What I Learned:

**Normal labs don't mean you're fine.**

The "normal" range is based on 95% of the population—including sick people. So you can be suffering and still be "normal."

**You know your body better than anyone.**

If you feel like something's wrong, something IS wrong. Trust yourself.

**Healing requires knowledge and strategy.**

You can't advocate for yourself if you don't know what to ask for, what to look for, or what to push back on.

---

That Tuesday morning? That was my wake-up call.

I decided I was done waiting for someone to save me. I became my own advocate. My own researcher. My own healer.

**And everything changed.**

---

### Why I'm Telling You This:

Because yesterday I launched my **Thyroid Health Mastery Course** and it already has 12 people enrolled. *(UPDATE THIS NUMBER)*

But I know there are more of you out there who need this.

More people lying in bed right now, wondering if they'll ever feel normal again.

More people being told "it's just stress" when they KNOW it's more than that.

More people ready to take control but not knowing where to start.

**This course is your starting point.**

👉 **[GET THE COURSE - $97]** (INSERT LINK)

---

### What You Get:
- How to read your labs (and know when to demand more tests)
- Medication strategies that actually work
- Nutrition protocols that support thyroid function
- Stress management for thyroid warriors
- How to find doctors who actually listen
- Private community of people who GET IT

**Plus my personal promise:**  
If it doesn't help, I'll refund every penny. 30 days. No questions.

---

### Time is Running Out:

38 spots left at $97. *(UPDATE THIS NUMBER)*  
After that, price goes to $197.

Sale ends Monday at midnight.

Don't let this be another "I should have..." moment.

You deserve to feel like yourself again. Let me help you get there. 🦋

**P.S.** That Tuesday? It was 7 years ago. Today I woke up with energy. I worked out. I wrote this email. I'm LIVING.

It took time, but I got here. And you can too.

## 📧 EMAIL #3: OVERCOMING OBJECTIONS
**Send: Day 3 (Afternoon)**

---

**Subject Line Options:**
1. "But I can't afford it..." (Let me address that) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
2. "3 reasons people don't buy (and why they're wrong)"
3. "What if it doesn't work for me?"
4. "The real cost of waiting"

---

**Email Body:**

---

**Subject: "But I can't afford it..." (Let me address that)**

Hey [FIRST NAME],

I've gotten a few replies to my course launch emails, and I want to address the most common concern:

**"RoSeé, I want this, but I can't afford $97 right now."**

I get it. I really do.

I've been broke, sick, and scared about every dollar. I've had to choose between supplements and groceries. I've cried in the pharmacy when my medication cost more than expected.

**Money stress + health stress = the worst combination.**

So let me be real with you about the actual cost...

---

### The Real Numbers:

**One specialist appointment with labs:** $300-600  
**One month of quality supplements:** $75-150  
**One ER visit from thyroid crisis:** $2,000-5,000  
**Years of feeling like crap:** Priceless (and exhausting)

**This course:** $97 (or $37/month for 3 months)

---

### Here's What the Course Replaces:

✅ **Hours of googling** (and getting more confused)  
✅ **Expensive "thyroid specialists"** who don't listen  
✅ **Buying random supplements** that don't work together  
✅ **Trial and error** with your health (and your money)  
✅ **Feeling alone** in your struggle

---

### What Past Students Say:

**Maya T. (Washington, DC):**  
*"I spent $3,000 on doctors in 6 months. This $97 course taught me more than all of them combined."*

**Keisha M. (Baltimore, MD):**  
*"I was taking 10 different supplements ($200/month). Now I take 4 that actually work together ($60/month). This course paid for itself in ONE month."*

**Simone W. (Arlington, VA):**  
*"I finally got my doctor to test Free T3 and Reverse T3. Turns out my 'normal' TSH was hiding a big problem. Worth every penny."*

---

### The Payment Plan:

If $97 upfront feels like too much, I offer payment plans:

**$37/month for 3 months**

That's about $1.25 a day. Less than a coffee. For knowledge that lasts forever.

👉 **[START WITH PAYMENT PLAN]** (INSERT LINK)

---

### The Money-Back Guarantee:

Still worried? Don't be.

**If you don't feel like this course gave you more value than the $97 you paid, I'll refund every single penny.**

No hoops. No hassle. No questions.

You have 30 days to decide.

**That means ZERO RISK.**

---

### The Real Cost:

Here's what I want you to ask yourself:

**What's the cost of NOT investing in your health right now?**

- More months of feeling like crap?
- More doctor visits that don't help?
- More Googling at 2 AM, terrified?
- More energy lost that you can't get back?
- More life missed while you wait to feel better?

---

### Time is Running Out:

**32 spots left at $97.** *(UPDATE THIS NUMBER)*  
Sale ends Monday at midnight.

After that, it's $197. Period.

Don't let money be the reason you stay stuck.
