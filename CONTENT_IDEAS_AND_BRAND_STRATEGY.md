# Content Ideas & DoGood Brand Strategy

## 🎬 "First Ingredient" Video Clip Idea

### Concept
Create a short, informative, and shareable video clip explaining the importance of reading the **first ingredient** on food labels.

### Key Message
"The first ingredient is listed first because it's the MOST abundant ingredient in that food. If the first ingredient is sugar, corn syrup, or something you can't pronounce—that's what you're mainly eating!"

### Video Script Outline (60-90 seconds)

**Hook (0-5 seconds):**
*[Hold up a product]*
"Stop! Before you buy that, read THIS..." *[points to ingredient list]*

**Education (5-40 seconds):**
"The FIRST ingredient is listed first for a reason—it's the most abundant thing in that product. 

So if you pick up a 'healthy' granola bar and the first ingredient is SUGAR or high fructose corn syrup? That's not a health food—that's candy in disguise.

*[Show examples of products]*
- Yogurt with sugar as ingredient #1? Nope.
- Bread with enriched wheat flour? Where's the WHOLE grain?
- Juice with 'from concentrate'? That's sugar water.

Look for products where the FIRST ingredient is:
✅ Whole grains (whole wheat, oats, quinoa)
✅ Real vegetables or fruits
✅ Quality protein (chicken, eggs, beans)
✅ Recognizable, real food"

**Call to Action (40-60 seconds):**
"Next time you're shopping, flip it over, read that first ingredient, and ask yourself: 'Is this what I REALLY want to be eating the most of?'

Your body deserves better. Do good by reading labels. I'm RoSeé from AskDoGood, and I'm here to help you navigate real wellness."

**End Card:**
"Follow @AskDoGood for more real talk about health"

### Production Notes
- Film in grocery store (check permissions) or at home with products
- Use on-screen text overlays for key points
- Show real product examples
- Keep energy high and relatable
- Use humor where appropriate ("That's candy in disguise!")

### Distribution Strategy
- Post on TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts
- Pin comment with link to full blog post about reading food labels
- Create carousel version for Instagram feed
- Use hashtags: #FoodLabels #HealthTips #ReadYourLabels #CleanEating #WellnessTips #FirstIngredient #BlackWellness #DoGood

### Potential Follow-Up Content
1. "5 Worst First Ingredients to Avoid"
2. "Best First Ingredients for [Specific Health Goals]"
3. "First Ingredient Challenge" - audience shares their pantry discoveries
4. "Marketing Tricks: When 'Healthy' Labels Lie"
