## LAB REFERENCE RANGES & WHAT THEY MEAN

### PRIMARY THYROID TESTS

#### TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone)
**What it is:** Signal from your pituitary to your thyroid to make hormones

**Lab Range:** 0.4 - 4.0 mIU/L  
**OPTIMAL Range:** 0.5 - 2.0 mIU/L  
**Best Range if on medication:** 0.8 - 1.5 mIU/L

| Result | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| > 4.0 | HIGH - Hypothyroidism (underactive) |
| 2.0 - 4.0 | GRAY AREA - Subclinical hypothyroidism (may have symptoms) |
| 0.5 - 2.0 | OPTIMAL |
| 0.4 - 0.5 | LOW NORMAL - Borderline |
| < 0.4 | LOW - Hyperthyroidism or overmedicated |

**Action:** If TSH is > 2.0, insist on testing Free T4 and Free T3

---

#### FREE T4 (Thyroxine)
**What it is:** The inactive form of thyroid hormone. Must be converted to T3 to work.

**Lab Range:** 0.8 - 1.8 ng/dL  
**OPTIMAL Range:** 1.2 - 1.8 ng/dL (upper half to high)

| Result | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| > 1.8 | HIGH - Too much hormone (hyperthyroidism) |
| 1.2 - 1.8 | OPTIMAL |
| 0.8 - 1.2 | LOW-NORMAL - May feel symptoms despite "normal" TSH |
| < 0.8 | LOW - Hypothyroidism |

**Action:** If Free T4 is in lower half of range, may need dose increase

---

#### FREE T3 (Triiodothyronine)
**What it is:** The ACTIVE form your cells actually use. What makes you feel energetic.

**Lab Range:** 2.3 - 4.2 pg/mL  
**OPTIMAL Range:** 3.5 - 4.2 pg/mL (upper half to high)

| Result | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| > 4.2 | HIGH - Too much active hormone |
| 3.5 - 4.2 | OPTIMAL - Energetic, clear thinking |
| 2.3 - 3.5 | LOW-NORMAL - Fatigue, brain fog despite "normal" TSH |
| < 2.3 | LOW - Major fatigue and dysfunction |

**Action:** If Free T3 is low despite normal Free T4, conversion problem (need selenium, zinc, reduce stress)

---

#### REVERSE T3
**What it is:** Inactive form that blocks T3 from working. High reverse T3 = stuck hormones.

**Lab Range:** 9.2 - 24 ng/dL  
**OPTIMAL Range:** < 15 (or ratio of Free T3 : Reverse T3 > 0.3)

| Result | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| > 24 | HIGH - Stress, poor conversion, inflammation |
| 15 - 24 | BORDERLINE - Conversion problem brewing |
| < 15 | GOOD - Hormones converting properly |

**Action:** If high, focus on: stress reduction, selenium, sleep, reduce inflammation

---

### AUTOIMMUNE MARKERS (for Hashimoto's diagnosis)

#### TPO ANTIBODIES (Thyroid Peroxidase)
**What it is:** Immune system attacking your thyroid

**Lab Range:** < 35 IU/mL = Negative  
**OPTIMAL Range:** < 10 IU/mL

| Result | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| > 500 | POSITIVE for Hashimoto's (very high) |
| 35 - 500 | POSITIVE for Hashimoto's |
| < 35 | NEGATIVE (no Hashimoto's, or very early) |

**Action:** If positive, go gluten-free, reduce inflammation, support gut

---

#### THYROGLOBULIN ANTIBODIES (TG Antibodies)
**What it is:** Another immune marker attacking thyroid

**Lab Range:** < 40 IU/mL = Negative  

| Result | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| > 40 | POSITIVE for autoimmune thyroid |
| < 40 | NEGATIVE |

**Note:** Often elevated together with TPO. Similar management.

---

#### TSI / TRAb (for Graves' Disease)
**What it is:** Immune system attacking thyroid receptor (causes hyperthyroidism)

**Lab Range:** < 0.50 IU/L = Negative

| Result | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| > 0.50 | POSITIVE for Graves' Disease |
| < 0.50 | NEGATIVE |

**Action:** If positive, see endocrinologist. Different treatment than Hashimoto's.

---

### NUTRIENT STATUS (Critical for thyroid)

#### VITAMIN D (25-Hydroxyvitamin D)
**Optimal for Thyroid:** 60 - 80 ng/mL

| Result | Status | Action |
|--------|--------|--------|
| > 100 | Too high (rare) | Reduce supplementation |
| 60 - 80 | OPTIMAL | Maintain current dose |
| 40 - 60 | Adequate | Increase to 5,000-10,000 IU |
| 30 - 40 | Insufficient | Start 10,000 IU daily |
| < 30 | Deficient | Start 10,000-15,000 IU daily |

---

#### IRON PANEL (Ferritin)
**Critical for:** T4→T3 conversion, oxygen transport

**Optimal Range:** 40 - 100 ng/mL (for women)

| Result | Status | Action |
|--------|--------|--------|
| < 30 | DEFICIENT | Add grass-fed red meat 3x/week, may need supplement |
| 30 - 40 | LOW | Increase iron-rich foods |
| 40 - 100 | OPTIMAL | Keep current intake |
| > 100 | HIGH | Reduce red meat, consult doctor |

---

#### VITAMIN B12
**Critical for:** Energy, mood, thyroid metabolism

**Optimal Range:** > 500 pg/mL (not just "normal")

| Result | Status | Action |
|--------|--------|--------|
| < 200 | DEFICIENT | Start B12 supplementation or injections |
| 200 - 500 | LOW | Take B-Complex supplement |
| > 500 | OPTIMAL | Continue current intake |

---

**Optimal Range:** > 10 ng/mL

| Result | Status | Action |
|--------|--------|--------|
| < 5 | DEFICIENT | Start methylfolate supplement |
| 5 - 10 | LOW | Take B-Complex with methylfolate |
| > 10 | OPTIMAL | Continue current |

**Optimal Range (8am):** 10 - 20 mcg/dL

| Result | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| > 25 | HIGH - Chronic stress affecting thyroid |
| 15 - 25 | ELEVATED - Stress management needed |

## DOCTOR CONVERSATION SCRIPT

**Use this when requesting tests:**

"Hi Dr. [Name], I'd like to optimize my thyroid health. Can we run a comprehensive panel? Here's what I'm requesting:

I'd like TSH, Free T4, Free T3, Reverse T3, TPO and thyroglobulin antibodies, vitamin D, B12, iron, magnesium, and cortisol.

I'm interested in getting my levels to OPTIMAL, not just 'normal range.' Can we discuss what that looks like for my individual situation?"

## TRACKING YOUR LABS OVER TIME

**Use this to spot trends and see if treatment is working:**

| Date | TSH | Free T4 | Free T3 | Reverse T3 | Vit D | Notes |
|------|-----|---------|---------|-----------|-------|-------|
| _____ | ____ | ____ | ____ | ____ | ____ | |
| _____ | ____ | ____ | ____ | ____ | ____ | |
| _____ | ____ | ____ | ____ | ____ | ____ | |
| _____ | ____ | ____ | ____ | ____ | ____ | |

**Healthy Trends:**
- TSH moving toward 1.0
- Free T4 moving higher
- Free T3 moving higher
