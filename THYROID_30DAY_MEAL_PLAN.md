## TROUBLESHOOTING

**Q: I don't like fish**
A: Get omega-3s from grass-fed beef, eggs, nuts. Take fish oil supplement.

**Q: What about vegetarian?**
A: Very difficult for thyroid. But can use: lots of eggs, dairy (if tolerated), nuts, seeds, beans.

**Q: How much should I eat?**
A: Eat until satisfied (not stuffed). Listen to hunger cues. Most people need 1,600-2,000 calories.

**Q: Can I eat fruit?**
A: Yes! Berries, apples, citrus (especially with meals). Avoid dried fruit & fruit juice.

**Q: What about dairy?**
A: If tolerated, organic grassfed is best. Many thyroid patients do better off dairy. Try elimination.
