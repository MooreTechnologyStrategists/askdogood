# My Journey Page Redesign Plan

## Current Issues Identified
1. **Generic placeholder images** - All milestones use the same 4-5 recycled images
2. **Cluttered Key Milestones section** - 13 items in a grid format is overwhelming
3. **Date inconsistency** - Mix of year ranges, specific dates, and "Now → Future" format
4. **No personal photos** - Missing authentic connection with your story
5. **Hero image** - Generic, doesn't capture your essence or journey

## Proposed Improvements

### 1. Hero Image Recommendation
**Type:** Professional portrait or candid photo of you in a moment of strength/reflection
**Alternatives if no photo available:**
- Sunrise/dawn over a cityscape (symbolizing new beginnings)
- Hands typing on laptop with warm lighting (work/purpose)
- Abstract journey/path imagery with warm, hopeful tones
- Silhouette in contemplation with natural light

**Style:** Warm tones, authentic, hopeful, professional but approachable
