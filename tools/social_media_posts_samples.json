This isn't just a personal health issue—it's a matter of health equity and systemic advocacy.\n\nKey challenges:\n• Implicit bias in medical settings\n• Limited access to endocrinologists\n• Symptoms attributed to \"stress\" or \"lifestyle\"\n• Lack of comprehensive testing protocols\n• Cultural barriers to self-advocacy\n\nWhat needs to change:\n✅ Standard protocols for comprehensive thyroid panels\n✅ Cultural competency training in medical education\n✅ Patient empowerment and self-advocacy resources\n✅ Increased research on thyroid disease in diverse populations\n\nI wrote this article because representation matters in healthcare narratives.
