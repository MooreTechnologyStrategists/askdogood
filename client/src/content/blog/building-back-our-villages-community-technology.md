# Building Back Our Villages: Community, Technology, and the Future We Deserve

"It takes a village to raise a child."

We've all heard that African proverb, right? But here's the real question: **What happens when the village is gone?**

For Black and brown communities across America—from the DMV to North Carolina, South Carolina, New York, Connecticut, Delaware, Pennsylvania—our villages have been systematically dismantled. Through redlining, gentrification, mass incarceration, economic disinvestment, and cultural erasure, the communal structures that once held us together have been torn apart.

And now, as we stand on the edge of an AI-driven technological revolution, we're facing another potential divide: **Who gets left behind when the world goes digital?**

Let's talk about rebuilding our villages, ensuring our communities have access to technology and education, and creating a future where nobody—and I mean **nobody**—gets left behind.

## The Village We Lost: How Community Structures Were Destroyed

Once upon a time, Black communities had thriving villages. I'm talking about:
- **Greenwood in Tulsa** (destroyed in the 1921 massacre)
- **Black Wall Street in Durham, NC**
- **Harlem Renaissance in New York**
- **Freedmen's Town in Houston**
- **U Street in DC** (before urban renewal)

These weren't just neighborhoods—they were **self-sufficient ecosystems** with Black-owned businesses, churches as community centers, fraternal organizations, mutual aid societies, and strong intergenerational bonds.

### What Happened?

#### 1. **Redlining and Segregation**
The **Federal Housing Administration (FHA)**, created in 1934, literally drew red lines around Black neighborhoods, deeming them "hazardous" for investment. This meant:
- Banks wouldn't lend to Black families
- Property values couldn't increase
- Businesses couldn't get capital
- Infrastructure and services deteriorated

According to the **Brookings Institution's 2020 analysis**, homes in majority-Black neighborhoods are undervalued by **$48,000 per home on average**, totaling **$156 billion in cumulative losses**. That's stolen wealth.

#### 2. **Urban Renewal = Negro Removal**
In the 1950s-70s, "urban renewal" projects bulldozed Black neighborhoods under the guise of "progress." Highways were built **through** thriving Black communities, cutting them in half. According to the **National Trust for Historic Preservation**, urban renewal programs destroyed over **1,600 Black communities** and displaced over **1 million residents**.

Example: **I-95 in the DMV** tore through historically Black neighborhoods in DC and Baltimore. **I-40 in Durham, NC** destroyed the thriving Black business district on Hayti.

#### 3. **Gentrification**
Fast forward to today: Black neighborhoods that survived urban renewal are now targets for gentrification. Developers move in, rents skyrocket, longtime residents are pushed out. The **National Community Reinvestment Coalition found that between 2000-2013**, **135,000 Black and Hispanic residents** were displaced from gentrifying neighborhoods.

In DC, **Barry Farm, Southwest DC, and parts of Anacostia** are being transformed. **Brooklyn in New York**—once the heart of Black culture—is now mostly unaffordable for Black families. **North Carolina cities like Durham, Raleigh, and Charlotte** are experiencing rapid gentrification, pricing out the very communities that built them.

#### 4. **Mass Incarceration**
The **War on Drugs**, launched in the 1980s, decimated Black communities. According to the **NAACP's Criminal Justice Fact Sheet**:
- **African Americans are incarcerated at more than 5 times the rate of whites**
- 1 in 3 Black men can expect to go to prison in their lifetime
- Over **5 million children have had a parent incarcerated**

When you remove fathers, brothers, uncles, and sons from communities, you destroy family structures and economic stability. You break the village.

#### 5. **Economic Disinvestment**
Black-owned businesses declined from **100,000+ in the 1970s to about 134,000 today** (out of 32 million total businesses), according to the **Association for Enterprise Opportunity**. Why?
- Lack of access to capital (Black entrepreneurs receive **1% of venture capital funding**, per Crunchbase)
- Discriminatory lending practices
- Competition from big-box stores in redlined areas
- Loss of community purchasing power

When Black dollars don't circulate in Black communities, the village can't sustain itself.

## The Digital Divide: Technology as the New Redline

Now we're facing a new threat: **the digital divide**. As the world rapidly adopts AI, automation, and advanced technologies, Black and brown communities risk being left behind—again.

### The Numbers Are Alarming

According to the **Pew Research Center's 2021 Digital Divide report**:
- **25% of Black Americans and 23% of Hispanic Americans** lack home broadband, compared to **14% of white Americans**
- **43% of Black adults and 48% of Hispanic adults** rely solely on smartphones for internet access (no desktop/laptop)
- **17% of Black households with school-age children** lack high-speed internet, hindering education

The **National Digital Inclusion Alliance** found that **39 million Americans** lack access to broadband, disproportionately affecting:
- Rural communities (including Black Belt South, Appalachia, Native reservations)
- Low-income urban areas
- Elderly residents

### Why the Digital Divide Matters

Lack of technology access means:
- **Educational gaps**: Kids can't do homework, access online learning resources, or develop digital literacy skills
- **Employment barriers**: Can't apply for jobs online, work remotely, or access training programs
- **Health disparities**: Can't access telehealth services, health information, or medical records
- **Economic exclusion**: Can't start online businesses, access banking, or participate in the digital economy
- **Civic disengagement**: Can't access government services, voting information, or community resources

And now, with AI about to transform **every industry**, those without digital access will be left even further behind.

## The AI Revolution: Opportunity or Threat?

Artificial Intelligence is here, and it's moving fast. ChatGPT dropped and changed everything overnight. AI is now being used for:
- **Job automation** (manufacturing, customer service, data entry, even creative work)
- **Healthcare diagnostics** (detecting diseases, personalized medicine)
- **Financial services** (lending decisions, fraud detection, investment management)
- **Education** (personalized learning, tutoring, grading)
- **Content creation** (writing, art, music, video)

According to **McKinsey Global Institute's 2023 report**, AI could displace **400-800 million workers globally by 2030**. In the U.S., **16% of jobs** are at high risk of automation, with the highest impacts on:
- Retail workers
- Food service workers
- Office administrative roles
- Manufacturing and production

Guess which communities are overrepresented in these roles? That's right: **Black and brown workers**.

### The Bias Problem

AI isn't neutral—it's built by humans with biases, trained on historical data that reflects systemic racism. Research shows:
- **Facial recognition systems are 10-100 times more likely to misidentify Black faces** (MIT Media Lab, 2019)
- **AI hiring tools discriminate against Black applicants** with "ethnic-sounding" names (UC Berkeley study, 2021)
- **Predictive policing algorithms target Black neighborhoods**, perpetuating over-policing (ProPublica investigation, 2016)
- **Credit scoring algorithms deny Black applicants at higher rates** (The Markup analysis, 2021)

If we're not at the table designing, auditing, and regulating AI, **it will replicate and amplify existing inequalities**.

### The Opportunity

But here's the flip side: **AI also presents massive opportunities** for those who can access and harness it.
- **Entrepreneurship**: AI tools lower barriers to starting businesses (automated customer service, marketing, bookkeeping)
- **Healthcare**: AI-powered diagnostics could close gaps in medical care access
- **Education**: Personalized AI tutors could provide educational support regardless of zip code
- **Creativity**: AI tools for art, music, writing, and design democratize creative industries
- **Economic empowerment**: AI skills are in high demand with lucrative salaries

The question is: **Will Black and brown communities be creators and beneficiaries of AI, or will we be left behind?**

## Building Back the Village: A Blueprint for Community Restoration

Alright, enough doom and gloom. How do we actually rebuild our villages and ensure our communities thrive in the 21st century?

### 1. **Reclaim Economic Power: Buy Black, Bank Black, Build Black**

We need to circulate Black dollars within Black communities. The **Maggie Lena Walker model** from early 1900s Richmond, VA showed this works: she created a Black-owned bank, newspaper, and department store that built wealth in her community.

**Actionable Steps:**
- **Support Black-owned businesses**: Use directories like **Official Black Wall Street, WeBuyBlack, Support Black Owned** to find Black businesses in your area
- **Bank with Black-owned financial institutions**: **OneUnited Bank, Industrial Bank (DC), Liberty Bank (New Orleans), Citizens Trust Bank (Atlanta)**
- **Invest in Black entrepreneurs**: Support Black-led crowdfunding campaigns, invest in Black-owned startups through platforms like **Wefunder** or **Republic**
- **Create co-ops**: Form worker-owned or community-owned businesses that keep wealth in the community

According to a **2019 Nielsen Report**, Black buying power is **$1.3 trillion**, but **$0.97 of every dollar** leaves the Black community immediately. If we circulated Black dollars just **one more time** before they left the community, we'd create massive wealth.

### 2. **Rebuild Community Institutions**

We need to strengthen and create institutions that serve our communities:

#### **A. Community Centers**
Physical spaces for gathering, learning, organizing, and healing. Examples:
- **Harriet's Apothecary in Brooklyn**: Combines healing justice with community organizing
- **East of the River in DC**: Provides youth programming, job training, and family support
- **The Village of Arts and Humanities in Philly**: Uses art and agriculture for community transformation

**What You Can Do:**
- Support existing community centers with your time or donations
- Transform vacant buildings into community-owned spaces
- Partner with churches, libraries, and schools to host community programs

#### **B. Black-Owned Media**
We need to tell our own stories and control our own narratives.
- **Support Black newspapers**: *The Washington Informer (DC), The Charlotte Post (NC), The Philadelphia Tribune (PA), New York Amsterdam News*
- **Follow Black digital media**: *The Root, Blavity, Essence, Ebony*
- **Create your own platforms**: Podcasts, YouTube channels, blogs, newsletters

#### **C. Mentorship and Educational Programs**
- **Programs like HBCU pathways, UNCF, Jack and Jill, 100 Black Men, Big Brothers Big Sisters** provide crucial support
- **Urban Journalism Workshop (WABJ) in DC** gives high school students journalism skills
- **Code2040, Black Girls CODE, Hidden Genius Project** teach tech skills to Black youth
- **Invest in the next generation**—mentor, tutor, coach, or sponsor a student

### 3. **Bridge the Digital Divide: Technology Access for All**

We can't build a 21st-century village without 21st-century tools.

#### **Expand Broadband Access**
- **Support the Digital Equity Act**: Federal funding to expand broadband in underserved communities
- **Advocate for municipal broadband**: Cities like **Chattanooga, TN** offer high-speed internet as a utility
- **Push for affordable internet programs**: **Comcast Internet Essentials, Spectrum Internet Assist, AT&T Access** offer low-cost options for qualifying families

#### **Provide Devices**
- **Support programs like PCs for People, Human-I-T, and Comp-U-Dopt** that refurbish and distribute computers to low-income families
- **Push schools to provide laptops/tablets** to all students (not just during COVID)
- **Organize community device drives** to collect and redistribute used electronics

#### **Teach Digital Literacy**
It's not enough to have devices—people need skills. We need:
- **Free digital literacy classes** at libraries, community centers, and churches
- **Tech training programs** focused on Black and brown adults (especially elderly folks)
- **Youth coding camps and STEM programs**

### 4. **Democratize AI and Emerging Tech: Nobody Gets Left Behind**

We can't let AI become another tool of oppression. We need to:

#### **A. Demand Representation in Tech**
According to **2023 data from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission**:
- **Black workers represent only 8% of employees** in the tech industry
- **Black people hold only 3% of leadership positions** in tech
- **Less than 1% of tech executives** are Black

We need more Black engineers, data scientists, AI researchers, product managers, and tech executives. This requires:
- **Pipeline programs**: Invest in **HBCUs, coding bootcamps, apprenticeships**
- **Diverse hiring**: Hold tech companies accountable for diversifying their workforce
- **Mentorship and sponsorship**: Create pathways for Black folks to advance in tech careers

#### **B. Build Our Own Tech**
We can't just work for Silicon Valley—we need to **build Black-owned tech companies** solving problems in our communities.

Examples:
- **Calendly** (founded by Tope Awotona, Nigerian immigrant)
- **Walker & Company Brands** (founded by Tristan Walker, sold to P&G)
- **Partpic** (founded by Jewel Burks, acquired by Amazon)

**Support Black tech founders** through:
- **Harlem Capital, Backstage Capital, Cross Culture Ventures**: VCs focused on underrepresented founders
- **Accelerators like Founder Gym, NewME, and CODE2040**: Provide training and funding

#### **C. Learn AI Skills Now**
AI literacy will be as important as reading and writing. Start learning:
- **Free AI courses**: Google AI, Microsoft AI, fast.ai, Coursera
- **Experiment with AI tools**: ChatGPT, Claude, Midjourney, Runway, ElevenLabs
- **Join AI communities**: Discord servers, Reddit, local meetups
- **Teach others**: Share what you learn with family and community

### 5. **Advocate for Systemic Change**

Individual action is important, but we also need **policy change**.

#### **A. Reparations**
Plain and simple: **America owes Black people**. The **cost of slavery, Jim Crow, and ongoing discrimination** is estimated at **$14 trillion** (according to economist William Darity Jr.).

Reparations would:
- Close the racial wealth gap
- Fund HBCU endowments
- Invest in Black communities
- Provide capital for Black businesses
- Address generational poverty

**Support HR 40 (Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals)** and local reparations initiatives in cities like **Evanston, IL; Asheville, NC; and San Francisco, CA**.

#### **B. Equitable Funding for Schools and Communities**
- **End property tax-based school funding** (which perpetuates segregation and inequality)
- **Increase funding for Title I schools** in low-income areas
- **Invest in community infrastructure**: Parks, libraries, health centers, youth programs

#### **C. Criminal Justice Reform**
- **End cash bail** (keeps poor people in jail pre-trial)
- **Decriminalize marijuana** and expunge past convictions
- **End mandatory minimums** and three-strikes laws
- **Invest in community-based safety** instead of policing (mental health response, violence interruption programs)
- **Ban the box**: Remove questions about criminal history from job applications

#### **D. Fair Housing and Anti-Gentrification Policies**
- **Community land trusts**: Ensure long-term affordability
- **Rent control and tenant protections**
- **First-time homebuyer programs for Black families**
- **Tax incentives for longtime residents** to prevent displacement

## The Bottom Line: The Village Lives in Us

They tried to break us, but we're still here. They tried to erase us, but we're still standing. They tried to divide us, but we're coming back together.

The village was never just a place—it's **a spirit, a practice, a commitment to each other**.

Rebuilding our villages means:
- **Supporting each other economically**
- **Investing in our children's futures**
- **Preserving our culture and history**
- **Embracing technology without losing our humanity**
- **Fighting for systemic change while building community power**

We can't wait for permission or for someone to save us. **We are the ones we've been waiting for.**

So let's build. Let's organize. Let's educate. Let's create. Let's love on each other. Let's make sure **nobody gets left behind**.

Because **when we move, we move as a village**.
