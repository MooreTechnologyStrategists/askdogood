# The Cost of Getting High: How Marijuana Is Affecting Our Youth 

**By: AskDoGood | Published: November 28, 2025 | Category: Community Health**

I'm going to say something that might be unpopular: we need to have an honest conversation about marijuana and our young people. Not the "reefer madness" scare tactics from the past, but a real, evidence-based discussion about what regular marijuana use is doing to developing brains—and how it's affecting the futures of Black youth in particular.

This isn't about judgment. This isn't about criminalizing or demonizing anyone. This is about love. Love for our community, love for our children, and love for the futures they deserve to have.

## The Normalization of Marijuana in Our Community

Let's be real: marijuana use is deeply normalized in many Black communities. It's in the music, it's in social gatherings, it's presented as harmless fun or even a form of self-care. With legalization spreading across the country, the message young people are getting is that weed is no big deal.

But here's what we're not talking about enough: **the marijuana available today is not the same as what was around 20 or 30 years ago**. THC concentrations have skyrocketed. In the 1990s, the average THC content in marijuana was around 4%. Today, it's often **15-25%**, with some concentrates reaching **90% or higher**.

This means young people are using a much more potent drug than previous generations, and they're starting younger. According to recent data, **about 1 in 5 high school students** report using marijuana in the past month. For Black youth, the numbers are similar or higher in many communities.

## What Marijuana Does to the Developing Brain

Here's the science we can't ignore: **the human brain doesn't finish developing until around age 25**. The parts of the brain that develop last are the ones responsible for:
- Decision-making and judgment
- Impulse control
- Planning and organization
- Emotional regulation
- Memory and learning

When young people use marijuana regularly, especially during adolescence, they're interfering with this critical development process. Research shows that regular marijuana use during the teen years is associated with:

### Cognitive Impairment

Studies have found that people who start using marijuana heavily in their teens and continue into adulthood show **significant declines in IQ**—an average of 8 points, which is enough to move someone from average intelligence to below average. This decline persists even after they stop using.

### Memory and Learning Problems

Marijuana affects the hippocampus, the part of the brain crucial for forming new memories. Young people who use marijuana regularly often struggle with:
- Remembering what they just learned in class
- Retaining information for tests
- Following multi-step instructions
- Organizing their thoughts and work

### Reduced Motivation and Achievement

There's a reason "amotivational syndrome" is associated with heavy marijuana use. Regular users often experience:
- Decreased interest in activities they used to enjoy
- Lower academic performance
- Reduced career ambitions
- Difficulty setting and achieving goals

### Mental Health Risks

Regular marijuana use, especially of high-potency products, is linked to increased risk of:
- **Anxiety and panic attacks**: Particularly with high-THC strains
- **Depression**: Both as a cause and a consequence of use
- **Psychosis**: Heavy use, especially in teens, increases the risk of developing schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders

## The "Frying Your Brain" Reality

When I say marijuana is "frying brains," I'm not being dramatic. I'm talking about the actual structural and functional changes that happen in the brain with regular use.

Brain imaging studies show that adolescents who use marijuana regularly have:
- **Reduced volume** in brain regions involved in memory and learning
- **Altered connectivity** between different brain regions
- **Changes in white matter** (the brain's communication highways)
- **Impaired neural efficiency** (the brain has to work harder to do the same tasks)

These aren't temporary effects. Some of these changes persist even after months or years of abstinence.

## The Opportunity Cost

Beyond the direct brain effects, there's an opportunity cost to regular marijuana use that we don't talk about enough. When young people are getting high regularly, they're not:
- Developing healthy coping skills for stress and emotions
- Building the discipline needed for academic and career success
- Forming deep, meaningful relationships
- Discovering their true passions and talents
- Laying the foundation for their future

I've seen too many bright, talented young Black people lose years of their lives to weed. They start smoking in high school, thinking it's harmless. By their early 20s, they're struggling to hold down a job, finish school, or figure out what they want to do with their lives. The ambition is gone. The drive is gone. And they can't understand why they feel stuck.

## The Racial Justice Angle

Here's where it gets even more complicated: while marijuana legalization is spreading, **Black people are still arrested for marijuana-related offenses at much higher rates than white people**, even though usage rates are similar. This means that Black youth face disproportionate legal consequences for the same behavior.

But here's what I want to say: **just because the criminal justice system is racist doesn't mean marijuana is harmless**. We can fight for decriminalization and racial justice while also being honest about the health risks, especially for young people.

Our youth deserve better than to have their potential stolen by a substance that's marketed to them as harmless. They deserve to know the truth so they can make informed decisions about their health and their futures.

## What Parents and Community Members Can Do

If you're a parent, mentor, or community member who cares about young people, here's what you can do:

### 1. **Have Honest Conversations**

Don't just say "drugs are bad." Talk about the specific risks to the developing brain. Share real stories of people whose lives were derailed by regular marijuana use. Be honest about your own experiences if you have them.

### 2. **Model Healthy Coping**

If you use marijuana to cope with stress, anxiety, or trauma, your kids are learning that's how to handle difficult emotions. Show them healthier alternatives: exercise, therapy, meditation, creative expression, community support.

### 3. **Create Opportunities**

Young people are more likely to use substances when they're bored, disconnected, or don't see a path forward. Help them find:
- Mentors and role models
- After-school programs and activities
- Job and internship opportunities
- Pathways to college or vocational training

### 4. **Get Them Help If They Need It**

If a young person in your life is using marijuana regularly, don't ignore it. Talk to them. Get them connected with counseling or substance use treatment. The earlier you intervene, the better the outcomes.

### 5. **Advocate for Better Education**

Push for evidence-based drug education in schools—not scare tactics, but real information about how substances affect the developing brain and how to make healthy choices.

## A Message to Young People

If you're a young person reading this, I want you to know: I'm not trying to tell you what to do. I'm trying to give you information so you can make the best decisions for yourself.

Your brain is still developing. It's building the foundation for everything you're going to do in your life. Every time you smoke, you're interfering with that process. You might not notice the effects right away, but they add up.

I know life is stressful. I know you might be dealing with trauma, racism, economic hardship, family problems. I know marijuana might feel like it helps you cope. But it's a short-term solution that creates long-term problems.

You are so much more than what you're going through right now. You have potential that you haven't even discovered yet. Don't let weed steal that from you.

## The Bottom Line

Marijuana isn't harmless, especially for young people. The science is clear: regular use during adolescence and young adulthood can cause lasting damage to the developing brain, affecting memory, learning, motivation, and mental health.

Our community deserves to know this. Our young people deserve to know this. And we owe it to them to have these conversations with love, honesty, and a commitment to their futures.
