# World Peace Starts With Healthcare: Why Free Healthcare Isn't Radical—It's Necessary

Look, I'm not here to sugarcoat it: America's healthcare system is broken, and it's killing us—literally. While we out here talking about world peace and unity, folks in our communities are rationing insulin, skipping doctor appointments, and dying from preventable diseases because they can't afford basic care. That ain't peace. That's violence with a prescription pad.

## The Real Cost of "Healthcare"

Let me put you on game. The United States spends more on healthcare than any other developed nation—we're talking **$4.3 trillion annually** according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS, 2023). That's about **$12,900 per person**. But here's the kicker: we rank **last** among 11 high-income countries in healthcare outcomes, according to the Commonwealth Fund's 2021 report.

Meanwhile, countries like the UK, Canada, France, Germany, and even Japan provide universal healthcare to their citizens. Not as some socialist fantasy, but as a **basic human right**. Their citizens aren't choosing between chemotherapy and keeping the lights on. They're not crowdfunding surgeries on GoFundMe. They're living, thriving, and contributing to society without the constant anxiety of medical bankruptcy.

### The Data Don't Lie

According to a 2019 study published in the American Journal of Public Health, **45,000 Americans die every year** due to lack of health insurance. That's 123 people a day. That's a whole community every year. And who's hit hardest? You already know: Black, brown, Indigenous communities, poor folks, and people living in rural areas.

The Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) reported in 2022 that **Black Americans are 1.5 times more likely** to be uninsured compared to white Americans. Hispanic Americans? **2.5 times more likely**. And even when we do have insurance, we're getting substandard care. The CDC's 2021 Health Disparities Report showed that Black women are **3-4 times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes** than white women, regardless of education or income level.

This isn't just statistics—these are our mothers, sisters, aunties, cousins. These are us.

## Healthcare as a Foundation for Peace

Now, you might be thinking: "RoSeé, what does healthcare have to do with world peace?" Everything, boo. Everything.

Think about it: How can we build peaceful, stable communities when people are stressed about medical bills? When chronic pain goes untreated because folks can't afford to see a doctor? When mental health issues spiral because therapy is a luxury only the wealthy can access?

**Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs** taught us that you can't focus on self-actualization, creativity, or community building when your basic physiological needs aren't met. Health is foundational. Without it, everything else crumbles.

### The Ripple Effect of Healthcare Access

When people have access to healthcare:
- **Mental health improves**: The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) found that untreated mental health conditions cost the U.S. economy $193 billion annually in lost earnings. Free mental health care means people can heal, process trauma, and show up fully for their families and communities.
- **Economic stability increases**: Medical debt is the leading cause of bankruptcy in America, accounting for **66.5% of all bankruptcies** according to a 2019 American Journal of Public Health study. Universal healthcare eliminates this crisis.
- **Education outcomes improve**: Kids who have access to regular healthcare miss fewer school days, perform better academically, and have better long-term outcomes (CDC, 2020).
- **Crime decreases**: Multiple studies, including research from the Journal of Health Economics (2018), show correlations between healthcare access and reduced crime rates. When people aren't desperate, they make better choices.

## The Global Standard: What Other Countries Got Right

Let's take a quick world tour, shall we?

### United Kingdom: The NHS
The National Health Service (NHS) has provided free healthcare to UK residents since 1948. **Zero copays, zero deductibles, zero medical bankruptcy**. Is it perfect? No. But Brits aren't dying because they can't afford insulin. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the UK spends about **$4,500 per capita** on healthcare—a third of what we spend—with better outcomes.

### Canada: Single-Payer System
Our neighbors up north have had Medicare for all since 1984. Canadians live an average of **three years longer** than Americans (WHO, 2022), and their infant mortality rate is lower. Maternal mortality? Also lower. And they're not paying $1,000 for an ambulance ride or $50 for a single dose of Tylenol in the hospital.

### France: Top-Ranked Healthcare
France consistently ranks #1 in the WHO's healthcare system rankings. They spend about **$5,000 per capita**—still way less than us—and cover everyone. Preventative care is free, chronic disease management is comprehensive, and maternal care is a priority. French mothers get **16 weeks of paid maternity leave** with full healthcare coverage. Meanwhile, we out here going back to work two weeks postpartum, bleeding through pads at our desk because we can't afford FMLA.

### Rwanda: Yes, Even Rwanda
Let me blow your mind: **Rwanda**, a country that experienced genocide in 1994, now has **91% health insurance coverage** through their community-based health insurance program (Mutuelle de Santé). They prioritized healthcare as part of rebuilding their nation. If Rwanda can do it 30 years after genocide, what's America's excuse?

## The American Resistance: Follow the Money

So why don't we have universal healthcare? Simple: **profit**.

The U.S. health insurance industry generated **$1.1 trillion in revenue** in 2022 (National Association of Insurance Commissioners). Health insurance CEOs make millions—sometimes tens of millions—annually. UnitedHealth Group's CEO made **$142 million** in 2021 alone, according to executive compensation data.

Big Pharma? They're not innocent either. Pharmaceutical companies spent **$374 million lobbying Congress** in 2021 (OpenSecrets.org). They're literally paying politicians to keep drug prices high and universal healthcare off the table.

### The Propaganda Machine

We've been fed lies about "socialist medicine" and "long wait times" and "government overreach." But here's the truth:
- **Wait times**: Americans already wait. The average wait time to see a family doctor in the U.S. is **24 days** (Merritt Hawkins, 2022). In Canada, it's comparable or shorter for urgent cases.
- **Quality**: Countries with universal healthcare consistently rank higher in healthcare outcomes than the U.S.
- **Freedom**: Real freedom is not being chained to a job you hate because you need health insurance. Real freedom is being able to start a business without worrying about coverage. Real freedom is not watching your loved ones die preventable deaths.

## What Black and Brown Communities Stand to Gain

For us, universal healthcare isn't just policy—it's **life-saving**. Here's what we're talking about:

### 1. **Closing the Maternal Mortality Gap**
With guaranteed prenatal and postnatal care, we can address the crisis killing our mothers. Doula care, midwife access, comprehensive OB-GYN services—all covered, all accessible.

### 2. **Managing Chronic Diseases**
Black Americans have the **highest rates of hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease** (CDC, 2022). Universal healthcare means regular check-ups, affordable medications, lifestyle medicine support—all the things that prevent these conditions from becoming death sentences.

### 3. **Mental Health Resources**
Therapy, trauma counseling, psychiatry—all accessible without the stigma or the sticker shock. Healing generational trauma isn't a luxury; it should be a right.

### 4. **Preventative Care**
Cancer screenings, well-woman exams, dental care, vision care—catching diseases early saves lives. The National Cancer Institute reports that **early detection increases survival rates by 90% for many cancers**.

### 5. **Economic Liberation**
Imagine not having medical debt. Imagine not working yourself to death for employer-sponsored insurance. Imagine starting that business, going back to school, or taking time off to heal without fear. That's economic liberation.

## The Path Forward: What We Can Do

I know this feels overwhelming, but change starts with us. Here's how we move forward:

### 1. **Educate Ourselves and Others**
Share information. Have conversations. Break down the myths. Knowledge is power, and the powers that be count on our ignorance.

### 2. **Support Healthcare Justice Organizations**
Organizations like **Physicians for a National Health Program (PNHP)**, **Healthcare NOW**, and **National Nurses United** are fighting for Medicare for All. Support them with your time, voice, or dollars.

### 3. **Vote Like Your Life Depends On It**
Because it does. Research candidates' healthcare positions. Support those who back universal healthcare. Show up to town halls and make your voice heard.

### 4. **Take Care of Each Other Now**
While we fight for systemic change, we take care of our own. Share resources, crowdfund for community members in need, support mutual aid networks. This is how we survive while we work toward thriving.

### 5. **Prioritize Our Health**
We can't fight if we're sick. Eat well, move your body, manage stress, seek help when you need it. Your health is resistance. Your wellness is revolutionary.

## The Bottom Line

World peace isn't some abstract concept for diplomats and politicians. Peace starts in our bodies, in our communities, in our ability to live without the constant threat of medical catastrophe. Free healthcare isn't radical—it's foundational.

Every other developed nation figured this out. It's time America caught up. And it's time we, as Black and brown folks, demanded what we deserve: comprehensive, quality healthcare as a basic human right.

Because real talk? You can't have world peace when half the population is one diagnosis away from financial ruin. You can't build unity when people are dying because they can't afford to live.

Healthcare is the foundation. Let's build on it.
