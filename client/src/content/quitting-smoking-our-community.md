# The Real Talk About Quitting Smoking (And Blunts) in Our Community

**By: AskDoGood | Published: November 28, 2025 | Category: Recovery & Wellness**

Let's be real: smoking is deeply woven into the fabric of our community. Whether it's cigarettes, blunts, or both, tobacco use is normalized in ways that make quitting feel almost impossible. I know because I've been there. And I'm here to tell you the truth about what smoking does to our bodies, why it's so hard to quit, and how you can actually break free.

This isn't a judgment piece. This is a love letter to anyone who's tried to quit and failed, anyone who knows they should stop but can't seem to, and anyone who's ready to finally put it down for good.

## Why Quitting Is So Hard (Especially for Us)

Nicotine is one of the most addictive substances on the planet. When you smoke, nicotine reaches your brain in about **10 seconds**, triggering a release of dopamine that makes you feel good. Your brain quickly learns to crave that feeling, and before you know it, you're hooked.

But for Black smokers, quitting is even harder because of factors that go beyond the chemical addiction:

**Cultural normalization.** In many Black communities, smoking—especially smoking blunts—is a social activity. It's part of hanging out, part of celebrating, part of coping with stress. When everyone around you smokes, quitting feels like you're going against the grain.

**Targeted marketing.** Tobacco companies have historically targeted Black communities with aggressive marketing, especially for menthol cigarettes. Studies show that **over 85% of Black smokers** use menthol cigarettes, which are harder to quit than non-menthol varieties because menthol makes the smoke smoother and easier to inhale deeply.

**Stress and trauma.** Let's be honest: being Black in America is stressful. We deal with systemic racism, economic inequality, and daily microaggressions. Smoking becomes a coping mechanism, a way to take the edge off. And when you're stressed, quitting feels impossible.

**Lack of access to cessation resources.** Black smokers are less likely to have access to smoking cessation programs, nicotine replacement therapy, or supportive healthcare providers. This makes quitting a lonely, unsupported battle.

## The Health Risks We Don't Talk About Enough

We all know smoking is bad for you. But let's get specific about what it's actually doing to your body, because sometimes knowing the details makes it real:

### Circulation and Heart Health

Smoking damages your blood vessels, making them narrow and stiff. This leads to:
- **Hypertension (high blood pressure)**: Your heart has to work harder to pump blood through damaged vessels
- **Increased risk of heart attack and stroke**: Black Americans already have higher rates of cardiovascular disease; smoking makes it worse
- **Poor circulation**: This can cause cold hands and feet, erectile dysfunction, and slow wound healing

### Respiratory Issues

Every time you inhale smoke, you're damaging your lungs. Over time, this leads to:
- **Chronic bronchitis**: Persistent cough, mucus production, and difficulty breathing
- **Emphysema**: Destruction of lung tissue that makes it hard to get enough oxygen
- **COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)**: A progressive disease that makes breathing increasingly difficult
- **Increased risk of lung cancer**: Smoking is responsible for about **90% of lung cancer deaths**

### The Blunt Reality

If you smoke blunts, you're getting a double hit: tobacco from the wrap plus whatever you're smoking inside. Blunt wraps are made from tobacco leaves, which means you're inhaling all the harmful chemicals from tobacco even if you're not smoking cigarettes.

Plus, people tend to inhale blunt smoke more deeply and hold it in longer, which increases exposure to toxins and tar. This can lead to the same respiratory problems as cigarette smoking, plus additional risks from whatever else is in the blunt.

## Why "I'll Quit Later" Doesn't Work

I used to tell myself I'd quit when I was ready. When life calmed down. When I wasn't so stressed. When I had more support. The truth? There's never a perfect time to quit. Life is always going to be stressful. There's always going to be a reason to put it off.

The longer you smoke, the more damage you do to your body. And some of that damage is irreversible. Every cigarette, every blunt, is another hit to your lungs, your heart, your circulation. The best time to quit was yesterday. The second-best time is right now.

## How to Actually Quit (Real Strategies That Work)

Quitting smoking is hard, but it's not impossible. Here's what actually works, based on research and real people's experiences:

### 1. **Pick a Quit Date and Prepare**

Don't just wake up one day and decide to quit cold turkey (unless that works for you—some people do better that way). Give yourself a week or two to prepare:
- Set a specific quit date
- Tell people you trust so they can support you
- Get rid of all your cigarettes, lighters, ashtrays, and blunt wraps
- Identify your triggers (stress, social situations, after meals) and plan how you'll handle them

### 2. **Use Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT)**

NRT can double your chances of quitting successfully. Options include:
- Nicotine patches
- Nicotine gum
- Nicotine lozenges
- Prescription medications like Chantix or Wellbutrin

Talk to your doctor about what might work best for you. And yes, NRT is way safer than continuing to smoke.

### 3. **Find New Coping Mechanisms**

If you smoke to manage stress, you need to replace that coping mechanism with something healthier:
- Exercise (even a 10-minute walk can reduce cravings)
- Deep breathing exercises
- Meditation or prayer
- Talking to a friend or therapist
- Creative outlets like music, art, or writing

### 4. **Change Your Environment**

If you always smoke in certain places or with certain people, you need to change those patterns:
- Avoid places where you used to smoke, especially in the first few weeks
- Spend time with non-smokers
- Change your routine (if you always smoked after coffee, switch to tea or take a walk instead)

### 5. **Expect Withdrawal and Have a Plan**

Nicotine withdrawal is real, and it sucks. You might experience:
- Intense cravings
- Irritability and mood swings
- Difficulty concentrating
- Increased appetite
- Trouble sleeping

These symptoms peak in the first few days and usually subside within 2-4 weeks. Knowing this ahead of time helps you push through instead of giving up.

### 6. **Don't Give Up If You Slip**

Most people try to quit multiple times before it sticks. If you smoke a cigarette or a blunt after quitting, don't beat yourself up and don't use it as an excuse to start smoking again. Learn from it, figure out what triggered the slip, and keep going.

## The Benefits Start Immediately

Here's the good news: your body starts healing the moment you quit.

| Time Since Quitting | What Happens in Your Body |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| 20 minutes | Heart rate and blood pressure drop |
| 12 hours | Carbon monoxide level in blood returns to normal |
| 2-12 weeks | Circulation improves and lung function increases |
| 1-9 months | Coughing and shortness of breath decrease |
| 1 year | Risk of heart disease is half that of a smoker |
| 5 years | Risk of stroke is reduced to that of a non-smoker |
| 10 years | Risk of lung cancer is about half that of a smoker |

## My Personal Journey

I smoked for years. Cigarettes, blunts, whatever was around. It was part of my social life, part of how I dealt with stress, part of my identity. Quitting felt impossible.

What finally made me stop? My thyroid cancer diagnosis. Suddenly, I was facing my own mortality, and I realized I couldn't keep poisoning my body while trying to heal it. It wasn't easy. I slipped up more than once. But I kept trying, and eventually, it stuck.

Now, I can breathe deeper. I have more energy. I don't wake up coughing. And I'm not spending money on something that was slowly killing me. If I can do it, you can too.
