# When Your Thyroid Symptoms Get Dismissed: A Black Woman's Reality

**By: AskDoGood | Published: November 28, 2025 | Category: Health Advocacy**

For 22 years, I lived with symptoms that doctors couldn't—or wouldn't—connect. The fatigue was crushing. The weight gain was relentless. The brain fog made me feel like I was losing myself. And every time I walked into a doctor's office hoping for answers, I walked out with the same message: "It's probably stress. Have you considered therapy?"

It took two decades and a cancer diagnosis for the medical system to finally take my thyroid seriously. And I'm not alone. Black women across this country are facing the same dismissals, the same gaslighting, and the same dangerous delays in diagnosis. It's time we talk about why this keeps happening—and what we can do about it.

## The Invisible Epidemic

Thyroid disease affects approximately **20 million Americans**, with women being **five to eight times more likely** than men to develop thyroid problems. But here's what the statistics don't always show: Black women face unique challenges in getting diagnosed and treated.

Research has consistently shown that **Black women are more likely to have their symptoms attributed to psychological causes** rather than physical illness. When we complain of fatigue, weight changes, or cognitive issues—all hallmark symptoms of thyroid dysfunction—we're often handed antidepressants instead of thyroid panels.

| Common Thyroid Symptoms | How They're Often Dismissed in Black Women |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Persistent fatigue | "You're just stressed" or "Try to get more sleep" |
| Unexplained weight gain | "You need to eat less and exercise more" |
| Brain fog and memory issues | "Maybe you're depressed" or "It's probably anxiety" |
| Hair loss | "That's just aging" or "It's genetic" |
| Cold intolerance | "Bundle up more" |
| Mood changes | "You should see a psychiatrist" |

## Why Black Women's Symptoms Get Overlooked

The reasons for this medical gaslighting are complex and rooted in systemic racism within healthcare. Several factors contribute to the problem:

**Racial bias in pain assessment.** Studies have shown that healthcare providers consistently underestimate pain and symptoms in Black patients compared to white patients. This bias extends to how seriously our complaints are taken and how thoroughly we're evaluated.

**The "strong Black woman" stereotype.** Cultural expectations that Black women should be resilient and uncomplaining can lead both patients and providers to minimize symptoms. We're expected to push through, to handle it, to not make a fuss—even when our bodies are screaming that something is wrong.

**Lack of representation in medical research.** Much of the foundational research on thyroid disease has been conducted primarily on white populations. This means that symptom presentations, reference ranges, and treatment protocols may not fully account for how thyroid disease manifests in Black women.

**Socioeconomic barriers.** Black women are more likely to lack consistent access to healthcare, to see different providers at each visit, and to have fragmented care. This makes it harder to establish the long-term relationship needed for a provider to recognize patterns in symptoms.

## The Mental Health Misdiagnosis Pipeline

Here's a pattern I've seen too many times, both in my own experience and in the stories of other Black women:

You go to the doctor complaining of crushing fatigue, weight gain despite eating well, and feeling like your brain is in a fog. Instead of ordering a comprehensive thyroid panel, the doctor asks about your stress levels, your sleep habits, your mood. Before you know it, you're walking out with a prescription for antidepressants and a recommendation to "manage your stress better."

The problem? **Thyroid dysfunction and depression share many symptoms**, including fatigue, weight changes, difficulty concentrating, and mood disturbances. But while depression is a psychological condition, thyroid disease is a physical one with measurable biomarkers. Treating one when you have the other doesn't just fail to help—it delays the correct diagnosis and allows the real problem to worsen.

In my case, I was prescribed antidepressants three separate times over the course of my 22-year journey. Each time, they didn't help—because I didn't have depression. I had a thyroid that was slowly failing, and eventually, cancer.

## What You Need to Know to Advocate for Yourself

If you're experiencing symptoms that could be thyroid-related, here's what you need to demand from your healthcare provider:

**Request a complete thyroid panel.** Don't settle for just TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone). Ask for:
- TSH
- Free T3
- Free T4
- Thyroid antibodies (TPO and TG)
- Reverse T3 (if symptoms persist despite normal TSH)

**Get your vitamin D levels checked.** Vitamin D deficiency is extremely common in Black women and can mimic or exacerbate thyroid symptoms. Low vitamin D can also affect thyroid function.

**Ask for a thyroid ultrasound if you have nodules or swelling.** Physical examination isn't always enough to detect thyroid abnormalities. An ultrasound can reveal nodules, cysts, or structural changes that need further evaluation.

**Keep a symptom journal.** Document your symptoms, their severity, and how they impact your daily life. Bring this to appointments. It's harder for a provider to dismiss written evidence of persistent, debilitating symptoms.

**Don't accept "your labs are normal" as the final answer if you still feel terrible.** Lab reference ranges are broad averages. What's "normal" for the general population might not be optimal for you. If your symptoms persist despite "normal" labs, push for further investigation or seek a second opinion.

**Trust your body.** You know when something is wrong. If a provider dismisses your concerns, find another provider. Your health is too important to leave in the hands of someone who won't listen.

## The Bigger Picture: Health Equity and Thyroid Care

My story isn't unique. It's part of a larger pattern of health disparities that affect Black women across every area of medicine. We're more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications, more likely to be undertreated for pain, more likely to have our symptoms dismissed as psychological rather than physical.

Thyroid disease is just one example of how systemic racism in healthcare puts Black women's lives at risk. Until we address the biases that lead providers to dismiss our symptoms, to under-test us, and to attribute physical illness to mental health problems, Black women will continue to suffer unnecessarily.

## What Needs to Change

**Medical education must address racial bias.** Healthcare providers need training on how implicit bias affects their diagnostic decisions and patient interactions.

**Research must include diverse populations.** We need more studies that specifically examine how thyroid disease presents and progresses in Black women.

**Healthcare systems must prioritize continuity of care.** Fragmented care makes it nearly impossible to track symptoms over time and recognize patterns.

**Patients need to be empowered to advocate for themselves.** We need to know what tests to ask for, what symptoms to track, and when to demand a second opinion.

## My Message to You

If you're reading this and you've been told your symptoms are "just stress" or "probably depression," but you know in your gut that something else is wrong—trust yourself. Push for the tests. Demand the answers. Find a provider who will listen.

It took me 22 years to get diagnosed. Twenty-two years of being told I was fine when I wasn't. Twenty-two years of my body trying to tell me something was wrong while the medical system told me I was imagining it.

You don't have to wait 22 years. You don't have to accept dismissal as the final answer. Your symptoms are real. Your pain is valid. And you deserve a healthcare provider who will take you seriously.
