## Email 2: Feature Spotlight - Label Scanner (Day 3)

**Subject Line:** This Tool Changed How I Read Food Labels 🔍

**Preview Text:** Scan any label and get instant health insights personalized to YOUR conditions...

**Email Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

Have you ever stood in the grocery store staring at a food label, trying to figure out if it's actually healthy?

I used to do that ALL the time. That's why I built the Smart Label Scanner.

**What It Does:**
🔍 Scan or type in any food product
💡 Get instant health analysis
⚠️ See warnings specific to YOUR conditions (like high blood pressure or thyroid issues)
✅ Get recommendations for better alternatives

**Why It's Different:**
Unlike generic nutrition apps, this scanner knows about YOUR health profile. It tells you if sodium is too high for blood pressure, if ingredients interfere with thyroid meds, and suggests healthier swaps.

**Try It Now:**
1. Go to https://askdogood.com/label-scanner
2. Set your health profile
3. Scan a product (or try the demo)

It's completely free to use. I built it because I needed it myself, and I wanted you to have it too.

See you in the aisles (virtually)!

## Implementation in Beehiiv

### Setting Up the Campaign:

1. **Create an Automation in Beehiiv:**
   - Go to Automations → Create New
   - Trigger: "Subscriber joins specific segment" (tag: wordpress-migration)
   - Or: "Subscriber subscribes to list"

2. **Add Email Sequence:**
   - Add each email as a step
   - Set delays between emails (Day 0, +3 days, +7 days, etc.)
   - Enable click tracking and analytics

3. **Tag Your Imported Subscribers:**
   - When importing CSV, add tag: "wordpress-migration"
   - This triggers the automation for all 1500 subscribers

4. **Customize with Merge Tags:**
   - `{{first_name}}` - subscriber's first name
   - `{{email}}` - subscriber's email
   - Use fallbacks: `{{first_name | default: "friend"}}`

5. **Track Performance:**
   - Monitor open rates (aim for 20-30%)
   - Track click-through rates (aim for 3-5%)
   - Adjust subject lines based on performance

## Pro Tips

1. **Personalization:** Always use first names when available
2. **Mobile-First:** Over 60% will read on mobile - keep it concise
3. **Clear CTAs:** One primary button per email
4. **A/B Test:** Test subject lines on 20% of list, send winner to remaining 80%
5. **Send Time:** Tuesday-Thursday, 9am-11am EST typically perform best
6. **Re-engagement:** If someone doesn't engage after 6 emails, add them to a "dormant" segment and try a different approach in 30 days
